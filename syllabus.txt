Keep responses short, clear, and margin-note style.

Priorities for Feedback


These were the expectations for the assignment

Option 2: Essay on cyberpolitical issues of final grade  

Length: 2000 words (8 pages), typed and double spaced.  Pages should be numbered, and the type of font should be no smaller than 12 characters per inch (e.g., Arial 12).  Students must submit their papers through the assignment tab in OWL and all papers may be processed by Turnitin.     

Topics: Students choose their own essay topics, but such choices must be approved by the instructor. No one is allowed to write on Stuxnet.  The essay must have, as part of its introduction, a statement of its thesis (central argument).  This thesis must be supported by a careful analysis of relevant data and arguments in the body of the paper. The assignment must be in proper formal essay format (no bullet points, short form or colloquial language, can use subheadings to identify sections, use proper citation and should NOT INCLUDE ANY FORM OF ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY. Dictionaries, encyclopedias, and Wikipedia should not be used, and use of web material is subject to instructor’s prior approval. A basic structure for the essay will include:   

 1)    Title, topic and thesis question or area of interest for potential research.  

2)    One dominant approach to study the issue. The dominant approach will provide the explanatory foundation of the thesis, more than one approach can be used, but the primary approach should be linked to the explanatory assertion of the thesis. 

 3)   Three key distinct arguments with evidence in support of the thesis. Remember to follow the paragraph structure in the course outline. The data should primarily come from course readings, the pre-approved suggested readings, and suggested texts. Students must engage with at least six course texts to complete the assignment, and most of your academic sources should come from the required and optional readings in the course outline.  

4)    A conclusion that mirrors your title, topic and thesis question. It is always a good idea to rewrite your introduction after you have written your conclusion. Your conclusion should provide the clear foundation that you have established throughout the essay, to demonstrate the validity of your thesis. Therefore, your thesis and your conclusion should match one another. Failure to have consistent argumentation will result in the inability to achieve full grades.  

5)   Properly cited research. In text citation is preferred (author date system, as outlined below in ‘guidelines for success in class). There should be no proxy urls (https://www.lib.uwo.ca/) no search urls (http://search.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/) or Dropbox urls (https://www.dropbox.com/). Citations need to be consistently formatted, readily available, in English, with precise page numbers (no inclusion of p.23-44, or consistent citation across pages (i.e. p.118-119). Lack of data is a lack of foundation. In the era of LLMs, inaccurate citations will be treated as no citation at all. LLMs routinely summarize sources without accessing the underlying data. Failure to directly quote sources with quotation marks followed by an explanation in your own words will constitute a lack of sufficient citation. Paraphrasing is no longer sufficient justification for including a citation; you must use specific and precise language, including nouns (specific people, places, and things), as generalized summaries of sources are often hallucinated, inaccurate, and incomplete when suggested by LLMs.  

6) A title page with your name, a title for your paper that reflects the thesis and topic of your paper, the date of submission and the course number on it. If you cannot clearly and simply identify the title and topic of your paper, it is often an indicator of a lack of focus.
